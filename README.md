[Pustaka Kalender Jawa](https://github.com/kalenderjawa)

**Pustaka** is JavaScript library for Javanese Calendar, this calendar is moon based calendar system and has been used by Javanese for many purposes in daily life till these days since 14th century.
 
Javanese calendar is arithmatic based calendar too and it's passed by generation to the next generation mostly by math formulas but ironically these days not so many new generation know or aware about this.
